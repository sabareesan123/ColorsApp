# ColorsApp

Hi Mr/Miss,


Please read below to know app better.

The app contains rest api which will communicate with mysql db to get the Colors and Votes details.
The home.htnl page displays colors when the page loads.

When the user clicks the color, the Votes table is populated by Votes.
The user can click the Total button and get the total value in the same page.

Run the application. open the url http://localhost:8080home.

Click any of thr color. The Color Blue and green has entries in the Votes table. So only Green and Blue color click will populate values in the Votes table.

Since spring hosting not supported by x1-hosting.com , I am piutting the app in Github.com

Thanks
Sabareesan
